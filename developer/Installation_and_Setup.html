                First, you will need to set up the VST SDK from Steinberg. See the Steinberg
                <a href="https://developer.steinberg.help/display/VST/How+to+set+up+my+system+for+VST+3"
                   target="_blank">installation documentation</a> but before generating the projects using CMake,
                finish reading this document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Download or clone the Überton project and place it so that the Überton folder is in the same folder
                as <span class="inlcode">VST_SDK</span> (which again should contain the VST library folder <span class="inlcode">vst3sdk</span>).
                To add the Überton library to the build process and the IDE project, you need to add the lines
                <pre class="code">
# Add Uberton library
set(UBERTON_SRC_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../Uberton")
set(UBERTON_BIN_PATH "${UBERTON_SRC_PATH}/build")

# Add Uberton Folder 
if(EXISTS ${UBERTON_SRC_PATH})
    add_subdirectory(${UBERTON_SRC_PATH} ${UBERTON_BIN_PATH})
endif()
</pre>
                to end of the <span class="inlcode">CMakeLists.txt</span> file found in the <span class="inlcode">vst3sdk</span> folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, configure cmake for the <span class="inlcode">vst3sdk</span> folder in VST_SDK
            </p>
            <p>
                For windows users, there occurs a little problem. When compiling the example plugins later,
                the output <span class="inlcode">.vst3</span> plugin is compiled to the Debug or Release folder. Your
                audio software will not find it there and that is why the build process attempts to create symbolic
                links in the <span class="inlcode">C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3</span> folder. This should be the
                solution except that it isn't because the permission to create symbolic links is not granted by default
                on windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several (half) solutions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Run Visual Studio as Administrator (which is the easiest solution).</li>
                    <li>
                        This <a href="https://developer.steinberg.help/display/VST/Preparation+on+Windows"
                                target="_blank">hint</a> in the Steinberg documentation also solves this problem, BUT:
                        it if your user account is the administrator. So if you have only one user account on your local
                        pc, then it is probably the administrator and for windows-specific reasons it seems you can never
                        get this to work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Instead, you can just remove the command to create the symbolic link by deselecting the option
                        <span class="inlcode">SMTG_CREATE_PLUGIN_LINK</span> before generating the project files
                        with cmake. But then you either need to add the Debug or Release folder to the scan locations in your
                        DAW or manually copy the plugins into <span class="inlcode">C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3</span>
                        each time you recompile
                        or create the symbolic links by hand. To do that you need to run the console (cmd) as admin (!) and navigate to
                        the VST3 folder and type
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span class=inlcode>
                            C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3> mklink ThePluginName.vst3
                            C:\Users\Me\VST_SDK\VST3_SDK\build\VST3\Release\ThePluginName.vst3
                        </span>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        (and of course replace the plugin name and your sdk location).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                For Mac users:
            </p>
            <p>
                Best use XCode. Unfortunately, there seems to be a bug in the cmake files. You'll might get an error
                that your XCode
                version is too old and that you need V9 or greater, even if you have Version 11 (latest version at the
                time of this writing): "XCode 9 or newer is required" Funny. Maybe the version comparion fails because
                the version is compared as string?? Anyway, you can just go to
                <span class="inlcode">VST3_SDK/cmake/modules/SMTG_DetectPlatform.cmake</span>
                and comment out the lines that say
                <pre class="code">
if(XCODE_VERSION VERSION_LESS "9")
    message(FATAL_ERROR "XCode 9 or newer is required")
endif()</pre>
                Note: this is not the solution if you are using XCode 8 or less! ;)
